* exapanded based on simplified
* copy simplified
* add in nodes one by one
* ensure carry lines
* split out target design
* add in NIF at the top (informs PP, optics, drivers, )
* add in breeder blankets (separate from first wall)
* grey out plasma physics links
* HR links to driver?
* Better labeling of icons in complex plot
* sqaush top - top is empty, bottom is busy
# Blog post idea
* 2 posts - one justification, one "Wardley Maps in scientific research"
* * this entire thing is imaginary ("envisaged"), but mostly not my imagination
* The goal of both major Fusion research projects is "will the fuel ignite?"
* * Not a question asked of any other power project
* Simplified
* Wardley Maps for the uninitiated
* "Visibility" in this context
* * what people will think of when they think of plasma physics, broadly
* Why I'm being so uncharitable
* * Ephasise position is based on *towards an IFE power plant*
* * * "Building laser physics experiments" should be more evolved
* Detailed
* highlight the major radiation issues (rep rate, cooling, debris, partial burn, energetic neutrons)
* * show the examples these hurts (first wall, optics, targets (speed), steel, Tritium market) with difficulties
* highlight that the Physics doesn't "matter" - if a powerplant works, is predictable and safe, then the Physics is less of an issue
* * theory led, vs "experiment" led ("experimental"/practice led is much more usual, it's also not always "experiment" - planes and engines were full products as hydro evolved to understand them)
* * * both theory and experiment contribute to R&D in practice
* * IFE is driven by Plasma Physics thou
* radioactive coating from partial burn
* quick references
* "Expertise" - the body of knowledge itself, how to run a fusion powerplant, does not exist
* NIF is primarily about developing the plasma physics
* Target design is evolving, but DD vs IDD (many think DD will be the way to go, energy efficiency but laser incident directly on the surface of the target has many different design requirements than IDD. Also, massssssssss production)
* Tritium market (kinda exists, Defense on govt side has stockpiles, precursor)
# Make code better
* CLI for this (dicking around with main is not happy)
* KeyError for missing node dependency is unclear
