* simplified
* where it needs to be
* - arrows to where it should be
* keys for arrow colours
* grey all arrows to plasma physics

# Blog post idea
* Simplified
* Wardley Maps for the uninitiated
* "Visibility" in this context
* Why I'm being so uncharitable
* * Ephasise position is based on *towards an IFE power plant*
* Detailed
* highlight the major radiation issues (rep rate, cooling, debris, partial burn, energetic neutrons)
* * show the examples these hurts (first wall, optics, targets (speed), steel, Tritium market) with difficulties
* highlight that the Physics doesn't "matter" - if a powerplant works, is predictable and safe, then the Physics is less of an issue
* * theory led, vs experimental led
* * IFE is driven by Plasma Physics thou
* quick references
* "Expertise" - the body of knowledge itself, how to run a fusion powerplant, does not exist
# Make code better
* CLI for this (dicking around with main is not happy)
* KeyError for missing node dependency is unclear
