* Generate a license to put on the map to help people reference me
* maybe shift all of the R&D nodes hard to the left (the map also contains genuine real stuff)
* Write README
* - Thoughts on how this doesn't really match to a R&D project this - genuinely unexplored?
- - - But then, is this all a good idea anyways?
* Targets need to have a design in them
* document axis values
# Prettier

You can set a marker from a Path
https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/marker_reference.html#markers-created-from-paths
FancyArrowPatch has very get_path functions

If it returns a "Path" object, one could inject one into the other

# Map
* FPP depends on Target Manufacture
* Target design depends on Laser System (and visa versa)
* Targets -> Target Design
* Consider structure (first wall problem)
# Structural
* Better word for arrow than "type"
* Look up other symbols Wardley uses for this
# Notes
* Tritium production includes; transport, manufacture, storage
* * Tritium Production is probably all here, it's very secret weapons stuff
