# Qs

I draw graphs with code, and I'm playing with Wardley Maps as a tool for communicating how projects could evolve.

## Is this a good idea?

Almost certainly not.

More specifically, pretty certain I should use JS. I know Python, not JS

## Why?

I enjoy coding. I like to draw things in my own style. I like to move things and change colours tiny bits at a time.

## Should any else use this?

Probably not. It's not for that. But feel free to try

# The labels always need moving

Right? The label-moving library is great, and while I did some complicated maths the one time and so think I could do better, the label-moving library actually implemented something that helps.

# Installing

Uses Python 3.10, also needs pip for Python 3.10.

Install invoke, `pip3.10 install -U invoke`
